Welcome to the **What Life Wants** project!

We are embarking on a collaborative journey to tackle one of the most significant challenges of our time: ensuring advanced artificial intelligence aligns with beneficial goals. Our approach is unconventional: we aim to build a rigorous, mathematical foundation based on understanding life itself as an information-theoretic process.

From this foundation, we hope to derive principles and perhaps even objective functions that can guide the development of safe and beneficial AI.

**Get Involved:**

* Learn more [About the Project]({{ '/about' | relative_url }}).
* Read the current draft of the [Main Paper]({{ '/paper' | relative_url }}).
* Find out [How to Contribute]({{ '/contribute' | relative_url }}).
* Join the discussion on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/D9EYEjcW).
* Explore the code and ongoing work on [GitHub](https://github.com/WhatLifeWants/WhatLifeWants.github.io/).

This is an open invitation to mathematicians, physicists, biologists, computer scientists, philosophers, AI safety researchers, and anyone interested in contributing rigorous thought to this critical endeavor. Let's figure out what life *really* wants, together.
