## How You Can Contribute

This project thrives on collaboration and critical engagement. Whether you're an expert in a relevant field or simply a careful thinker, your input is valuable. Here's how to get involved:

**1. Scrutinize and Discuss (GitHub Issues):**

* **Read:** Engage with the [Main Paper draft]({{ '/paper' | relative_url }}) and other documents in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/WhatLifeWants/WhatLifeWants.github.io/).
* **Critique:** If you find flaws, logical fallacies, unsupported claims, missing citations, areas needing clarification, or have suggestions, please **open a GitHub Issue**.
* **Be Specific:** Clearly describe the issue, reference the relevant section(s), and explain your reasoning. Constructive criticism is highly encouraged!
* **Discuss:** Engage in discussions on existing issues.

**2. Propose Changes (GitHub Pull Requests):**

* If you have concrete changes to propose (e.g., correcting a definition, adding a proof, rewriting a section, fixing a typo), please **submit a Pull Request (PR)**.
* **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy (fork) of the repository.
* **Make Changes:** Edit the relevant files in your fork.
* **Submit PR:** Create a Pull Request from your fork back to the main project repository. Explain your changes clearly in the PR description.
* **Review:** PRs will be reviewed by maintainers for rigor, clarity, and relevance to the project's goals.

**3. Join the Conversation (Discord):**

* For more informal discussion, brainstorming, and community interaction, join our [Discord Server]({{ page.discord }}).
    * *(Please note: Key decisions and formal critiques should still be documented via GitHub Issues/PRs for transparency and persistence).*
